# mimalloc 2.0.9: 5-Way Allocator Test and 200-Relay Deployment

*By 1AEO Team • January 2026*

*Experiment: 100 relays (5 groups × 20) on Debian 13 with Tor 0.4.8.x*

We tested 5 memory allocators on 100 Tor relays to find the best option for long-running Guard relays. The result: **mimalloc 2.0.9** used 7.4× less memory than mimalloc 3.0.1. We then migrated all 200 relays on the server to the winner.

## Experiment Design

| Group | Allocator | Relays | Test Period | Duration |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|----------|
| A | mimalloc 3.0.1 | 20 | Dec 31 – Jan 10 | 10 days |
| B | mimalloc 2.0.9 | 20 | Jan 2 – Jan 10 | 8 days |
| C | mimalloc 2.1.7 | 20 | Jan 2 – Jan 10 | 8 days |
| D | jemalloc 5.3.0 | 20 | Jan 4 – Jan 10 | 6 days |
| E | glibc 2.41 | 20 | Jan 2 – Jan 10 | 8 days |

All 5 groups ran simultaneously from Jan 4–10 (6 days). Each group had 20 relays with identical hardware and Tor configuration.

## Results (Jan 10, 2026)

| Allocator | Avg Memory | vs mimalloc 3.0.1 |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **mimalloc 2.0.9** | **1.41 GB** | **7.4× less** |
| mimalloc 2.1.7 | 1.83 GB | 5.7× less |
| jemalloc 5.3.0 | 2.74 GB | 3.8× less |
| glibc 2.41 | 4.15 GB | 2.5× less |
| mimalloc 3.0.1 | 10.44 GB | — |

## mimalloc 3.0.1 Regression

mimalloc 3.0.1 showed unbounded memory growth over 10 days:

| Day | Memory |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | ~1.9 GB |
| 5 | ~5.3 GB |
| 10 | 10.44 GB |

The memory continued growing at ~1 GB/day with no sign of stabilizing. In contrast, mimalloc 2.0.9 stabilized at ~1.4 GB by day 3 and remained flat.

## Why 2.x Works Better

The mimalloc 2.x series returns memory to the OS more aggressively. Changes in 3.x architecture—likely related to segment management—cause memory retention that doesn't suit Tor's allocation pattern (long-running process, many small allocations, directory cache churn).

## Production Migration

Based on these results, we migrated all 200 relays to mimalloc 2.0.9:

```bash
# Build mimalloc 2.0.9 from source (Debian 13 ships 3.0.1)
wget https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/archive/refs/tags/v2.0.9.tar.gz
tar xzf v2.0.9.tar.gz && cd mimalloc-2.0.9
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/mimalloc
sudo cp libmimalloc.so.2.0 /usr/local/lib/mimalloc/libmimalloc-2.0.9.so

# Configure systemd override for each relay
for relay in $(ls /var/lib/tor-instances/); do
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/tor@${relay}.service.d/
    cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/tor@${relay}.service.d/allocator.conf
[Service]
Environment="LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/mimalloc/libmimalloc-2.0.9.so"
EOF
done
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Debian 13 Warning

The `libmimalloc2.0` package on Debian 13 ships **mimalloc 3.0.1**—the version with the regression. Build 2.0.9 from source instead.

## Summary

| Recommendation | Allocator | Memory |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| Best | mimalloc 2.0.9 | 1.41 GB |
| Good | mimalloc 2.1.7 | 1.83 GB |
| Acceptable | jemalloc 5.3.0 | 2.74 GB |
| Avoid | mimalloc 3.0.1 | 10.44 GB |
