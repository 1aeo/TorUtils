# Tor Relay Configuration Example
# Copy to relay-config.csv and edit with your values
#
# Format: nickname,lan_ip,wan_ip,or_port,control_port,metrics_port
#
# FIRST ROW (required): all 6 fields
# FOLLOWING ROWS (required): nickname, wan_ip
# FOLLOWING ROWS (optional): lan_ip, or_port, control_port, metrics_port
#
# If omitted, or_port uses first relay's value
# If omitted, control_port/metrics_port auto-increment from first relay
# If lan_ip is empty, only WAN IP is used (no LAN binding)
#
# Example - 18 relays with auto-incrementing ports:
